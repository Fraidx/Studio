See a work: https://triplicates.github.io/Studio/

 ### Description
 This site is my second attempt at using BEM methodology. Also I used paralax effect and new library for me - Slick.io
 The project has a number of shortcomings: 
 * Low load speed for images
 * Poor usage BEM methodology
 
 ### Updates
   #### 08.04.2020 
   * I optimized images, the img folder with 20 mb turned 1.9 mb. Also i optimized images resolution
   * Tested using the HTML validator and fixed errors
   * Download speed index has increased from 6.4s to 3.2s 
   
   I didn't touch the layout and decided to leave the css, so that you can clearly see what mistakes I made
